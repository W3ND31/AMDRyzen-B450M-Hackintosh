# AMDRyzen-B450M-Hackintosh

This repository is an "backup" of my EFI files to run Hackintosh on my personal desktop.
Can help some guys trying to run on similar builds.

I was running Mac Os Big Sur Vanilla (11.1) without problems.
All USB ports are mapped, audio P2, Ethernet, Hdmi and iServices without headache.
Debug is disabled.

**MotherBoard**: AsRock Steel Legend B450M

**RAM**: 16GB (2x8GB) 3000Mhz HyperX Vengeance

**CPU**: Ryzen 5 3600 without OC

**Video**: RX 5500XT 8GB

**HD**: 2Tb WD

Any question just open a issue and i'll try to help!

Godspeed!
